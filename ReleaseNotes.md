# About this document

This file contains the tasks/issues which we implement in metasfresh, in a chronological fashion (latest first)

In this document, we sort of lean on http://www.semanticreleasenotes.org/, 
but since that spec doesn't (yet?) support multiple releases in one file, 
we only adhere to it as far as it's convenient in term of the documents structuring

Meanings of the categories we currently use:
 * uat: was migrated from the uat baseline
 * fix: a bugfix

Additional notes:
 * The metasfresh source code is hosted at https://github.com/metasfresh/metasfresh
 * The metasfresh website is at http://metasfresh.com/
 * You can also follow us on twitter: @metasfresh
