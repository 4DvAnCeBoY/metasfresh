			If the file KEYSTORE_REQUIRED.txt is present in a child project, then we assume that some code needs to be signed.
			Therefore, the parent-pom profile with id "prepare-code-signing" activates to download our keystores, 
			unack them into the "${project.build.directory}/keystore" folder
			and set's properties so that e.g. the printing client applet can be singned with our "developement" signature.
			Note that:
				*these default properties can be overridden from outside.
				*our "development" signature is not verified by a CA and is therefore not meant to be rolled out at the customer.
				*the actual signing does not take place in this profile, because different projects will sign different files 
				 (and might even use the keystore with different plugins).
